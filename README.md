# User Management App

This app is made using .NET core and has two versions. The default one is the MVC version that will need 'Update-Database -Context "ApplicationDbContext"' run in the package manager console in order to get the login and register feature of this to work.
There's an experimental version of this that needs a bit of styling and UI work done that turns this into a web api with a react frontend, can be accessed from this branch: Task-005a/feature/implement-react-frontend.

**Things to do:**

## Tasks
* Need to implement date picker for the user forms
* Figure out a way to add pagination for logs
* Implement unit tests
* implement a service layer
